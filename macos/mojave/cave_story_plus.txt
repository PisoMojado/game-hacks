In case it gets lost:
"""
Thought I'd share what I did to get Cave Story+ working on Sierra.

I had a hunch that it was a similar SDL version issue to SpaceChem, so I basically did the SDL.framework replacement that this tool does for SpaceChem: https://github.com/leafi/fix-spacechem-os-x

You still have to do the data folder trick, so all together the process via Terminal is:

1. `sudo ln -s ~/Library/Application\ Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Cave\ Story+/data /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/data`

(Or copy if you prefer.)

2. `curl -LO https://github.com/leafi/fix-spacechem-os-x/raw/master/bonsai.tar.bz2`

(Or just get SDL.framework version 1.2.14 somewhere else.)

3. `open bonsai.tar.bz2`

(Ignore the Finder window this opens and continue in Terminal.)

4. `rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Cave\ Story+/Cave\ Story+.app/Contents/Frameworks/SDL.framework`

(Make a backup first if you're paranoid.)

5. `cp -r bonsai/Frameworks/SDL.framework ~/Library/Application\ Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Cave\ Story+/Cave\ Story+.app/Contents/Frameworks/SDL.framework`

And you should be good to go!

In case it does not last, I have cloned the repo: https://github.com/PisoMojado/fix-spacechem-os-x
You can pull bonsai.tar.bz2 from this repo, as a backup.
